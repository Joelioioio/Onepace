I mean, it's just a random exclamation that isn't even on-screen for one second, and I rather doubt the fans would go "OH MY GAWD WHAT DID IKAROS SAY THERE I AM SO CONFUSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111one" if we left it out either. And including a TL-note for a random exclamation that isn't even on-screen for one second strikes me as kind of... pointless.}
